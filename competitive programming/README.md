Generate Hailstone Numbers in Java 

-------------------------------------------------------------

A Hailstone series is defined as follows: 
*  *  Start with any integer value greater than 0, say x. 
   * If x is even, then the next value in the series is x/2. 
   * If x is odd, then the next value in the series is 3x + 1. 
   * Now apply the same rules to create the next value in the series.


## Output

* 7
* 22
* 11
* 34
* 17
* 52
* 26
* 13
* 40
* 20
* 10
* 5
* 16
