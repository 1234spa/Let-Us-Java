# Rules of contribution

## Code contribution
- Please make sure to add your code in the directory that makes sense, if there is no directory present please make one
- Please name your code file as `code-file.java` and make sure it is same as the class name used inside (this ensures build passing, if no other issues are present)
- Please make sure to add a code that is not simply a print statement saying something random and an actual contribution
- Add as many codes you want, every contribution is welcome

## ReadMe contribution
- Please make sure that the formatting is all good and is not messy
- No PRs just for a few typos, however feel free to create a PR to style the ReadMe in a new or better way that looks nicer :)
